First register your app on GitHub

   https://github.com/settings/applications/new

Name

  localhost 

URL
 
  http://localhost:3000/

Callback URL

  http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback

Set environment variables for your local OS ( follow Linux/bash export )

  export GITHUB_KEY=put-your-Client-ID-here
  export GITHUB_SECRET=put-your-Client-Secret-here

Now create a brand new rails app. Please note we do skip Test::Unit files, skip Active Record files and we don't run bundle install.

  rails new host_app -T -O -B

Change directory to host_app

  cd host_app

Add mongoid (4.0.0) for rails 4 

  echo "gem 'mongoid', :git => 'git://github.com/mongoid/mongoid.git'" >> Gemfile
  
Include the engine in your app
  
  echo "gem 'gitkeeper'" >> Gemfile
  bundle install

Mount the engine adding the following to config/routes.rb

  HostApp::Application.routes.draw do
    mount Gitkeeper::Engine => "/auth"
  end

Config mongoid ( host_app/config/mongoid.yml ) and start MongoDB

  development:
    sessions:
      default:
        database: gitkeeper_dev
        hosts:
          - localhost:27017

Run the server

  rails s

Visit the following URL

  http://localhost:3000/auth

== N O T E :

This is a Rails engine, which has to be mounted on a new or pre-existing Rails 4.0 app. The User model here, is 'name spaced' within gitkeeper_users, as you can see from the following Rails logs :
